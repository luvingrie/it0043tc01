            <p class="desc"> Kuromi (クロミ, Kuromi) is a character from the My Melody universe. She is My Melody's rival
                and doppelgänger, and manifests as a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with
                a pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression on her forehead
                changes to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is on Halloween (October 31st). Her name
                translates from Japanese to English as "black beauty". Her mother and father wears a very similar outfit
                as herself. Kuromi makes her first appearance in 2005 as an antagonist of Onegai My Melody and is
                intended to be a mischievous, dark counterpart to My Melody, though in later current series such as
                Hello Kitty and Friends Supercute Adventures, her role is now changed into a more friendly demeanor with
                Hello Kitty and her friends, including My Melody herself.</p>

                Kitty's best friend, is a white rabbit from the Japanese characterization company Sanrio. When she
                debuted, she was portraying Little Red Riding Hood in her version of the classic fairy tale. That is why
                she wears a red (or pink) hood that covers her ears, often having a bow or a flower on her right side.
                She was born on January 18th in the magical forest of Mariland, the home to many of her friends.</p>

                1989. He is drawn as a white dog with black floppy ears, but no visible mouth. He is often dressed in
                athletic attire, as he has a sporty and playful personality. His favorite food is banana ice cream.
                Sanrio created him after losing the rights to Peanuts, and designed him after Snoopy.</p>

            <p class="desc"> Cinnamoroll (シナモロール), or otherwise referred to his real name as Cinnamon (シナモン), is a
                Sanrio character and the main character of the Cinnamoroll universe. He was born on March 6, on a cloud
                far up in the sky. Cinnamoroll is a small, shy and chubby dog with white fur, blue eyes, pink cheeks, a
                plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll (hence his name), and long and thick ears that
                enable him to fly. Cinnamon is shy but pure-hearted, and always willing to help out his friends when
                they need it. He works at Café Cinnamon, and sometimes sleeps on customers laps. His favorite food is,
                ironically enough, warm, fresh cinnamon rolls. Due to his unique peaceful nature and appearance,
                Cinnamoroll has since become a fan-favorite character for Sanrio; He was voted the most popular Sanrio
                character in 2020 - 2023, and won first place six times so far in the Sanrio Character Ranking starting
                in 2017. Cinnamon made his debut in 2002, but was created one year prior.</p>

                Donut Pond. Keroppi is one of the smallest characters. He is a green frog with big eyes. His mouth is
                typically V-shaped when closed, but certain scenes may give him different mouth shapes, such as the
                typical arch. His outfit consists of a red and white one-piece. He is usually seen with pink spots on
                his cheeks.</p>
